      "This is Freezy. He lead a long life of slingin' ice and rollin' dice. One day, when he couldn't pay his debts, collectors came and melted his family. Little did they know, unfortunately for them, that Freezy controls the elements around him. After finding the pool of water he once called his family; Freezy uses their remains to rain hellfire down upon the world. Freezy wishes to one day join his family, but upon receiving his powers he was cursed with being impervious to high temperatures. Yikes."
